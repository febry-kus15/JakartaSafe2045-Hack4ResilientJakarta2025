# 🌏 JAKSAFE 2045 – Smart Urban Resilience Platform for Jakarta

## Overview
**JAKSAFE 2045** is a hackathon project developed for **Hack4Resilient Jakarta 2025**, aiming to empower Jakarta’s citizens with accessible, actionable climate-disaster information. The platform helps users understand risks, adapt effectively, and take action when disasters occur.

## Problem Statement
Jakarta’s ambition to become a global city by 2045 is threatened by climate-related disasters such as flooding, land subsidence, and urban heat. These challenges are compounded by fragmented digital systems, limited climate literacy, and the absence of citizen-centric platforms. JAKSAFE addresses these gaps by integrating real-time monitoring, public awareness campaigns, and adaptive tools.

## Proposed Solution
JAKSAFE is a **community-centered digital platform** that:
- Maps climate vulnerabilities (flood zones, subsidence, heat islands)
- Offers location-based adaptation guidance
- Provides interactive educational content
- Includes gamified learning and emergency preparedness kits

## Key Features
- 🌐 **Interactive Climate Risk Map**: Explore hazards by location
- 🧰 **Adaptation & Action Toolkit**: Personalized recommendations
- 📚 **Downloadable Knowledge Base**: Infographics, printable guides
- 🎮 **Gamified Learning**: Quizzes and challenges to boost engagement
- 📱 **Mobile-Friendly Interface**: Designed for accessibility across devices

## Technical Stack
- **GIS Tools**: ArcGIS Pro, Rhino-Grasshopper
- **Programming**: Python for data processing and modeling
- **Design**: Figma, Mapbox for prototyping and UI/UX
- **Data Sources**: Climate, socio-demographic, infrastructure, land use, and spatial risk indicators

## Target Users
- Jakarta residents of all ages and educational backgrounds
- Community groups, schools, and local government agencies

## Expected Impact
- Increased climate literacy and disaster preparedness
- Reduced vulnerability through informed action
- Scalable model for other urban regions facing similar risks
