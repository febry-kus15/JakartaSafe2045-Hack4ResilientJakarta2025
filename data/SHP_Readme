🌊 Flood & Vulnerability Insights
This project provides two key datasets to support flood risk analysis and social vulnerability mapping across sub-districts.

📍 Flood Count
Displays the number of flooding incidents recorded in each sub-district from 2016 to 2018.

🧭 Social Vulnerability
Highlights areas with high social vulnerability, based on a weighted index of the following indicators:

👶 Children population
👵 Elderly population
🏙️ Population density
💸 Poverty levels
🌊 Flood exposure
These indicators help identify communities that may require prioritized support and intervention.
